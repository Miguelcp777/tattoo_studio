"""Reference adult anatomy (ADR-0008). Declared convention, never the user's measurements.

Each entry is the usable ink span of a body zone in millimetres: the area a tattooer would
realistically work within, not the anatomical extent of the limb. Values are deliberately
conservative — a span that is slightly small yields a tattoo that fits, a span that is slightly
large yields one that runs off the zone.

These numbers are illustrative. They are identical for every user regardless of build, which is
wrong in the individual case and honest only because it is labelled as reference anatomy. A
calibrated photograph supersedes them (TASK-0024/REQ-010).
