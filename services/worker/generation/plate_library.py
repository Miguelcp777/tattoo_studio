"""The skin plate library (TASK-0060, ADR-0027).

A generated plate is a blank, clothed photograph of one zone of a man's or a woman's body. It used
to be generated for every design: a paid call, a wait, and a refusal from the image provider's
safety system now and then (TASK-0059). The same 26 zones and two bodies recur, so each plate is
generated once, reviewed by a person, and committed here, like the style catalogue (ADR-0012).

Plates show the right side. A left-side design gets the same photograph mirrored. A brief that
names no body gets one of the two, chosen from its id, so every version of a design sits on the
same body.

This lives in ``generation`` because building the library makes outbound model calls (ARCH-INV-001).
Reading it makes none. ``app.build_plate_library`` is the runner.
