"""Image moderation via an OpenAI vision model.

Written against OpenAI's documented Responses API, confirmed 2026-09-19:

  POST https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
  Authorization: Bearer <OPENAI_API_KEY>
  {"model": "...", "input": [{"role": "user", "content": [
      {"type": "input_text",  "text": "..."},
      {"type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}]}]}

**Everything ambiguous raises**, and :class:`~safety.gate.InputGate` converts a raise into
a denial. A parse failure, a missing field, a non-boolean value, an HTTP error and a
timeout all mean the same thing operationally: nothing was verified. A moderation provider
that guesses is worse than one that fails, because the failure is visible.

This module performs an outbound call from `safety`, which ARCH-INV-001 permits since
TASK-0013. Routing it through `generation` was rejected: it would make the gate's
integrity depend on the module the gate exists to constrain.
