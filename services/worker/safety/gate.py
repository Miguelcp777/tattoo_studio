"""The safety input gate.

Screens bytes, before anything is stored and before anything is sent to a provider
(SEC-INV-007). That ordering is what makes this module depend on `contracts` alone and
not on `media` — at the moment the gate runs, there is nothing stored to look at.

**The gate currently denies everything.** TASK-0013 supplies a moderation provider that
can classify an image; until then no input can pass. A gate that cannot pass is useless
but safe. A gate that passes without checking is neither, and would be the most dangerous
shortcut available in this project — so the deny-by-default implementation is the real
one, not a stub with a TODO.
