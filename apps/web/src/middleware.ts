 * no network call and adds no latency to a page load. Anyone can forge a cookie and get the HTML
 * shell, which is why **every API route verifies the account properly with Supabase**. That is
 * where money is spent and stored work is read, and that is where the real check belongs.
 *
 * Its job is narrower and still worth doing: a visitor who is not signed in lands on the sign-in
 * page instead of a studio that fails on every action.
