/**
 * What the web tier reports for monitoring (TASK-0054).
 *
 * The web tier makes paid calls of its own — the consultation's Claude calls — and sees things the
 * worker cannot: sign-ins and the turns of a conversation. It reports them to the worker, which
 * keeps the only connection to the event database. This tier, which faces the internet, never
 * holds that credential.
 *
 * Reporting is fire-and-forget: it never delays a response and never fails one.
