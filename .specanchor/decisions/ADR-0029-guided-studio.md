# ADR-0029: The studio is guided by pop-ups; a professional description is drafted and editable

## Context

The owner asked for the whole experience to be guided by pop-ups: first «¿qué quieres tatuarte?»;
the agent reads the idea and improves it "para adaptarlo al objetivo final de tener un prompt
profesional"; then one question for whatever is missing (style, zone, side, body, colour); then the
references found, each removable, with a way to add one; then a summary in which every value can be
changed; only then does the studio work, and the result shows the mockup, the stencil, the changes
and the camera. Asked, the owner chose: one grouped pop-up for what is missing, the professional
description visible and editable, the chat and panel kept as «Modo avanzado», and the choice of the
client's own skin photo in the summary.

## Decision

1. **Four pop-ups** on the shared `Confirm` dialog, each with «Paso N de 4» and «Atrás»: idea,
   details (only what is missing; every detail when revisited), references (remove, add, search
   again only when an essential one is missing, continue without any), and summary (each value
   editable, the professional description, «Piel de estudio / Mi foto», and «Esto es lo que
   quiero», which saves any change, accepts the brief as saved and generates). Then a progress
   pop-up, the existing result dialog (images, downloads, changes, camera), and «Tu diseño está
   listo» with «Nuevo diseño» and the account's earlier designs.
2. **The step is resumed from the server's state** (`lib/wizard.ts`), so a reload lands at the
   details or the references of the consultation in progress, or at «listo» after a design.
3. **«Nuevo diseño» forgets the consultation in this browser** (`DELETE /api/consultation`); the
   account's designs stay. Sending the idea again after «Atrás» starts a clean consultation.
4. **Professional description:** `tattoo-brief.subject.refined` (optional, ≤ 1200 characters, also
   in the brief `studio-job` embeds). The architect drafts it in Spanish from the idea, keeping
   every element the client named and adding none; `description` stays the client's own words
   (TASK-0033). The client's edit wins over a later draft. It is part of the accepted brief, and the
   worker's artwork prompt leads with it.
5. **«Modo avanzado»** shows the previous chat and panel unchanged; the choice is remembered in the
   browser.

## Consequences

- The size is not asked; the studio proposes it and the summary lets the client change it.
- «Eliminar mis datos» stays in the advanced panel.
- The professional description is written by a model: the summary shows it next to the client's
  words precisely so that a drift can be seen and corrected before anything is generated.
