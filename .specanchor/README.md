# Project Spec Anchor

This repository uses the `sdd-spec-anchor` protocol. Contracts live here; code is verified against
them in both directions.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `global/` | Durable cross-cutting contracts |
| `modules/` | One spec per module in `module-map.json` |
| `decisions/` | ADRs |
| `tasks/` | Task specs, `TASK-NNNN.spec.md` |
| `evidence/` | Baselines and impact reviews |
| `findings/` | Out-of-scope discoveries |

## Choosing a task type

- **Light change** (`templates/task-lite.md`): localized, no change to an API, schema, permission,
  integration or architectural contract.
- **Full change** (`templates/task-spec.md`): new feature, cross-module work, or any contract
  change. Omit sections that do not inform a decision.

When in doubt, a change that touches anything listed under *Domain invariants* in a module spec is
a full change.

## Working protocol

1. Load the relevant global and module specs before editing.
2. Create a uniquely identified task. Record current behavior, desired behavior, scope and
   measurable acceptance criteria before implementing.
3. For contract changes, update the module spec before or alongside the code. The guard enforces
   this: a `contract` classification requires the affected module specs to have changed.
4. Implement, referencing IDs as `TASK-0007/REQ-001` and `TASK-0007/AC-001`.
5. Review the actual diff in both directions. Never rewrite a spec merely to legitimize an
   accidental implementation change.
6. Record a structured impact review and run the guard.
7. Close only when affected acceptance criteria pass and both reviews are complete.

## Commands

Local staged, unstaged and untracked changes:

```sh
python scripts/check-spec-sync.py --review .specanchor/evidence/impact-review.json
```

Committed branch changes against the target branch (`main`):

```sh
python scripts/check-spec-sync.py --base origin/main --review .specanchor/evidence/impact-review.json
```

Inventory and unmapped-file check:

```sh
python scripts/check-spec-sync.py --baseline
```

Project test suites run as **separate** checks. They do not exist yet; this section is updated in
TASK-0001 when the toolchain lands.

## What the guard does and does not prove

The guard checks documentary coverage: that changed files are classified, mapped to specs, and
linked to evidence that exists. It does **not** check whether the rationale is true, whether tests
actually ran, or whether code and spec agree in meaning.

Report the two results separately, always:

- Documentary coverage: `PASS` / `FAIL` / `NOT_RUN`
- Functional alignment: `ALIGNED` / `PARTIAL` / `DRIFT` / `NOT_VERIFIED`, in each direction

A guard pass is never evidence of correctness.

## Configuration notes

- `anchor.yaml` is JSON despite its extension. It must be version 2 and carry exactly the keys
  `version`, `spec_root`, `module_map`, `material_paths`, `exclude_paths`. Unknown keys fail.
- Patterns use Python `fnmatch`, where `*` matches slashes and `**` means nothing special.
  Module globs must not nest, or a file gets two owners and every change needs both specs.
- Adding a top-level source tree requires updating `module-map.json` in the same change.
