# Module: contracts

TASK-0028 (ADR-0012): `contracts/reference/style-library.json` holds the style catalogue — one
visual-characteristics phrase per style and three described variants — copied byte-identically
into the Python package and exported to TypeScript as `STYLE_CATALOGUE`. The phrase is held here
rather than in `flash/prompt.py` so the string shown to a client, the string that generated the
catalogue image, and the string sent for their tattoo are the same one.

TASK-0027 (ADR-0011): `styleName` grows from ten entries to sixteen with `tribal`, `geometric`,
`watercolour`, `new_school`, `chicano` and `biomechanical`. The vocabulary stays closed;
`tribal_freehand` remains the out-of-vocabulary fixture. `contracts/reference/body-zones.json`
is new canonical data — the reference spans of ADR-0008 plus the fractions a qualitative size
claims — copied byte-identically into the Python package by its generator and imported by
TypeScript, so the consultation and the worker cannot resolve a size from different numbers.
Three tests cover it: byte identity, one span per `bodyPart`, and spans within the contract's
millimetre bounds.

TASK-0023: transform optionally records sourceCropPx {left, top, width, height} for the
uncalibrated mockup projection, in original master pixels; legacy results stay valid.

TASK-0022: optional edit coverage enum larger/smaller/full and mode artwork/placement
are shared by studio-job and artifact provenance. Existing edit requests remain valid.

TASK-0020/REQ-004: studio-status adds fresh-ink-composite to the transform method enum
and optional bounded curvature (0..1.2 radians) and taper (0..0.35). Existing geometric-multiply remains valid.
Generated TS/Python copies and runtime validation share this canonical schema.

TASK-0021: studio-job optionally carries edit {parentJobId, instruction}; instructions are
3..1000 characters, trimmed at HTTP entry. Studio-status artifacts optionally carry edit
provenance and a retained background asset. Legacy results without these fields stay valid.
Parent brief revision increments per branch; design IDs continue to identify visual masters.

## Responsibility

Own every schema that crosses a module boundary. `TattooBrief` is the system's central contract:
the consultation produces it, and all three engines consume it.

## Source ownership

`contracts/` — JSON Schema files, the shared fixture corpus, and generated type artifacts.

## Public interfaces

Schemas:
- `schemas/tattoo-brief.schema.json` — the brief. **Exists** (TASK-0002), version `1.0.0`.
  Placement and size are embedded rather than extracted, until a second consumer exists.
- `schemas/design.schema.json` — generated artwork and its lineage. **Exists**
  (TASK-0004), version `1.0.0`. Records the brief revision that produced it
  (CONTRACTS-INV-003) and carries raster pixels without ever carrying millimetres.
- `job.schema.json`, `consent.schema.json` — planned, not built.

TypeScript (`@tattoo/contracts`):
- `validateTattooBrief(payload)` — returns every issue rather than throwing.
- `assertTattooBrief(payload)` — validates or throws `TattooBriefValidationError`.
- `TattooBrief`, `StyleName`, `BodyPart` — generated types.

Python (`tattoo-contracts`):
- `validate_tattoo_brief(payload)`, `is_valid_tattoo_brief(payload)`,
  `assert_tattoo_brief(payload)`, `tattoo_brief_schema()`.

**Authority versus ergonomics.** The validating authority in both runtimes is the schema
document itself, run through `ajv` in TypeScript and `jsonschema` in Python. Generated
artifacts — TypeScript interfaces and pydantic models — are for editor support and FastAPI
and are never consulted for a verdict. They cannot express the schema's conditional colour
rules, so a generated validator would silently accept payloads the schema rejects.

## Inputs and outputs

Inputs: none at runtime. Outputs: a validation verdict in either runtime, plus generated
types for editor support. See the authority note above; `zod` was considered and rejected in
the ADR-0004 refinement.

## Domain invariants

- CONTRACTS-INV-001: `TattooBrief` carries size in millimetres. Pixel dimensions are derived, never
  authoritative.
- CONTRACTS-INV-002: `style` is drawn from the closed curated vocabulary in the product-behavior
  spec; free text is not accepted in this field.
- CONTRACTS-INV-003: A `Design` records the brief revision that produced it.
- CONTRACTS-INV-004: Schema changes are additive, or carry an explicit version bump and migration.

## Data / persistence

None. This module defines shape, not storage.

## Dependencies

None (ARCH-INV-002).

## External integrations

None.

## Error semantics

Validation failures raise a typed error naming the schema, the failing path and the received type.

## Security and permissions

No secrets. Schemas must not require free-text fields that invite personal data where a
structured field would do.

## Observability

Validation failure counts by schema and field, to detect drift between the two runtimes.

## Performance / operational constraints

Validation is on every boundary crossing; it must stay negligible relative to a queued job.

## Tests / verification

One shared fixture corpus (valid and invalid cases) executed by both the TypeScript and the
Python validator. Divergence between them fails the build (ARCH-INV-005).

## Known uncertainties and debt

- `TattooBrief` now has a real consumer: the flash engine reads every field it defines.
  That closed the "no consumer" gap but surfaced a new one — see FINDING-0002, where a
  brief can validate and still be unrenderable because dimension bounds say nothing about
  the ratio between them.
- `Design` has no consumer yet. Whether its fields are the right fields is untested until
  the stencil and mockup engines read it.
- The vocabulary lists (10 styles, 26 body parts) were assembled without a practising tattooer's
  review. They are plausible, not authoritative.
- Size bounds of 5mm to 600mm are a judgement call, not a measured constraint.
- `design`, `job` and `consent` schemas do not exist.
- Fixture parity is asserted on accept-or-reject, not on which rule fired. Two runtimes could in
  principle reject the same payload for different reasons without the corpus noticing.

Resolved in TASK-0002: the generation mechanism (`json-schema-to-typescript` and
`datamodel-code-generator`, both committed) and the field-level content of `TattooBrief`.

## Alignment notes

Aligned as of TASK-0002 for `TattooBrief`. The remaining schemas named under *Public interfaces*
are declared ahead of the code that will own them.

Two parity hazards were found while implementing and are handled in the schema rather than left
to chance. `format` is assertive only when a format checker is wired up, and the ecosystems wire
it differently, so patterns are used instead. Python's `re` matches Unicode digits with `\d`
while JavaScript's does not, so every pattern spells out `[0-9]` — otherwise a timestamp with
Arabic-Indic digits would validate in Python and fail in TypeScript.

## Change history

- 2026-09-19: Created during SDD bootstrap.
- 2026-09-19 (TASK-0002): `TattooBrief` 1.0.0 defined; dual-runtime validation against the one
  schema document; 28-case shared corpus; generated artifacts committed with a reproducibility
  check.
- 2026-09-19 (TASK-0004): `Design` 1.0.0 added with a 24-case corpus. Validation generalised
  over a schema registry, so a new schema is covered by the corpus the moment it is
  registered. `py.typed` added — without it mypy treated this package as untyped in every
  consumer, silently disabling checking across the system's most important boundary.

## TASK-0019 current implementation and remaining intent

studio-job.schema.json and studio-status.schema.json now own studio request and result boundaries. TS and Python run their canonical schemas; generated types do not decide validity. Shared positive/negative corpora include readiness, ownership ID shapes, physical size, status/result consistency and no automatic fidelity certification.

Evidence: `.specanchor/evidence/TASK-0019/verification.md`. Earlier VERIFIED rows are historical.
The overall realistic-colour/anatomical product target remains PARTIAL; draft module status is retained.

TASK-0019/REQ-010: Palette is optional for colour and accents. Missing palette delegates selection to the design process using the idea and reviewed references; it is not a missing client answer. Empty panel input is omitted. Explicit palettes remain bounded and validated. Colour rendering remains pending.
