Every module remains `draft` at product level. All have source code. TASK-0019 connects
the local studio and records current checks. A bounded live public-reference generation
has produced artifacts; that is integration evidence, not a cultural/print-quality certification.

No module is `verified` as a whole. `contracts` comes closest, but its remaining schemas do not
exist and its field set is unproven against any consumer.

## Findings

| Finding | Summary | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FINDING-0001 | OpenAI's image model offers editing, relevant to the ADR-0002 mockup blend | open |
| FINDING-0002 | The brief contract permits size combinations flash cannot render | open |
| FINDING-0003 | `media` and `safety` declared a circular dependency | resolved (TASK-0012) |

## Decisions

| ADR | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-0001 | Hosted image models behind a provider adapter | proposed |
| ADR-0002 | Hybrid mockup: geometric warp then constrained AI blend | proposed |
| ADR-0003 | Stencil via native line-art pass and centerline vector trace | proposed |
| ADR-0004 | One JSON Schema as the source of truth for both runtimes | accepted (validated TASK-0002) |
| ADR-0005 | Next.js BFF and Python worker separated by a job queue | proposed |
| ADR-0006 | Privacy posture for body photographs | proposed |

## Invariant ownership

Cross-cutting invariants are declared in the global specs and enforced in named modules:

| Invariant | Declared in | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| ARCH-INV-001 sole outbound model call | architecture | generation (VERIFIED, TASK-0004) |
| ARCH-INV-005 schema parity across runtimes | architecture | contracts (VERIFIED, TASK-0002) |
| PROD-INV-001 design geometry preserved in mockup | product-behavior | mockup |
| PROD-INV-002 stencil prints 1:1 | product-behavior | stencil |
| PROD-INV-003 aging is illustrative | product-behavior | mockup, web |
| PROD-INV-004 no living-artist mimicry | product-behavior | safety, consultation, flash (PARTIAL: constructions only) |
| SEC-INV-001 no training on user photos | quality-and-security | generation |
| SEC-INV-002 EXIF stripped | quality-and-security | media (VERIFIED, TASK-0012) |
| SEC-INV-004 cascade deletion | quality-and-security | media (VERIFIED, TASK-0012) |
| SEC-INV-006 gates always active | quality-and-security | safety (PARTIAL: denies all) |
| SEC-INV-007 no unscreened photo leaves the system | quality-and-security | safety, media, generation |
