# Product Behavior

## Purpose

Define what the product promises the user and the tattooer, and — equally important — what it
must never appear to promise.

## Current behavior with evidence status

No implementation exists. All statements are INTENT.

## Intended behavior

Two audiences, two artifacts:

1. **The wearer** gets a consultation, a reference render, and an on-body mockup on their own
   photo, with optional healed/aged illustrations.
2. **The tattooer** gets a handoff sheet: the stencil at true 1:1 physical size, the reference
   render, the intended dimensions in millimetres, and placement notes.

The handoff sheet is the product's terminal value. A session that cannot produce one has failed,
regardless of how good the mockup looked.

## Constraints

- The user must be able to specify size in real units (mm) and that size must survive end to end.
- The user must be able to iterate. First generations are rejected as a rule, not an exception.
- Designs are versioned; a mockup always names the design version it rendered.

## Invariants

- PROD-INV-001: The design shown in a mockup is geometrically the same artwork as the design in
  the corresponding stencil. The mockup pipeline may not alter design geometry.
- PROD-INV-002: Stencil exports carry true physical dimensions and are printable at 1:1.
- PROD-INV-003: Aging and healing outputs are labeled illustrative and never presented as a
  prediction of the user's own healing.
- PROD-INV-004: The system does not offer to imitate a named living tattoo artist's style.
- PROD-INV-005: Every generated artifact is accompanied by a visible statement that it is a
  visualization, not a guarantee of the final tattoo.

## Conventions

- Style vocabulary is a closed, curated list (American traditional, fine-line, black-and-grey
  realism, neo-traditional, irezumi, blackwork, illustrative, ornamental, lettering, surrealism).
  Free-text style input is mapped onto this list by the consultation, never passed through raw.

## Non-goals

- Booking, payments to artists, or a marketplace.
- Medical or aftercare advice.
- Guaranteeing that any artist will or can execute the design.

## Evidence / sources

| Statement | Evidence status | Source / revision |
|---|---|---|
| Dual-output delivery (stencil + mockup) | INTENT | User request 2026-09-19 |
| Handoff sheet as terminal deliverable | INTENT | Planning session 2026-09-19 |
| Aging is illustrative, not predictive | INTENT | Planning session 2026-09-19 |
| Style-mimicry of living artists excluded | INTENT | Planning session 2026-09-19 |

## Unknowns

- Whether unauthenticated users may generate at all, or only after account creation.
- Free-tier quota and whether stencil export is gated.
- Whether the curated style list is user-extensible in a later version.

## Change history

- 2026-09-19: Created during SDD bootstrap. Status draft, no implementation.
